# OFETDatabase
ABOUT:
Currently Research experimentalists at UIUC and Georgia Tech under the Ying Diao Group & Martha Grover Lab are working on a joint collaboration project where they have been sharing hundreds of data points in regards to experimental data on polymer-based semiconducting devices. They are essentially collected the data on the fabrication process and the devices performance metrics as well.

THE PROBLEM:
Currently the researchers have an excel sheet where they track data, but as the experimentation process grows, using Excel sheets are hinder the development of this research. 

THE SOLUTION:
So to fix this I am developing a Full Stack CRUD Web Application that takes information from those Excel sheets and new manually inputted data and stores that in PostgreSQL database.
